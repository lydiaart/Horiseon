## Installation

1. clone the code from Git Hub.
2. download the files onto your computer.
3. ready to use.

## Usage

Users can access one of the three corresponding sections by clicking the links in the navigation. They are "Search Engine Optimization," "Online Reputation Management," and "Social Media Marketing." 

In the "Search Engine Optimization" section, business users will find the right customers through increased visibility.
In the "Online Reputation Management" section, business owners can avoid unnecessary negative reviews and have better control over what to show to potential customers.
In the "Social Media Marketing" section, social media marketing will help users to find the right platform and markets for their business.

On the right side of the three sections, there are "lead generation," "brand awareness," and "cost management."
"Lead generation" is to bring customers directly to the user's business.
"Brand awareness" is to increase the visibility of a user's business through paid and organic search.
"Cost management" is to decrease the cost of advertisement as the search ranking of the user's ranking increases.

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:
